lives in a city and is a male then the premium is Tk. 4 per thousand and his policy
amount cannot exceed Tk. 2 lakhs.
b. If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that the gender is female then the
premium is Tk. 3 per thousand and her policy amount cannot exceed Tk. 1 lakh.
c. If a personâ€™s health is poor and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in
a village and is a male then the premium is Tk. 6 per thousand and his policy cannot
